                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Established in 2016, Old Tavern Farm is a private boutique thoroughbred-breeding farm. Founded
                    on the former site of Palmerâ€™s Maple Shade Farm in Saratoga Springs, New York, the name Old
                    Tavern was derived from the 1800s tavern that once graced the property.</p>
            
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Nestled atop a ridge overlooking Saratoga Lake and the foothills of the Adirondacks, Old Tavern
                    Farm is focused on the breeding and sale of thoroughbreds that compete at the highest level of
                    racing. Since inception, Walt & Michelle Borisenok have meticulously restored the land back to its
                    agrarian roots, developing the farm into a state of the art breeding facility. Their stewardship
                    continues to be the cornerstone of Old Tavern Farm.</p>
